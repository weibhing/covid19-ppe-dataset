# COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detection Dataset for Object Detection Model
PPE plays a critical role in protecting individuals against any highly-infectious diseases, which is one of the precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of proper immunization. Thus, in an effort to contribute to our COVID-19 frontliners and the community, I have established a labelled PPE dataset which is the fundamental in training of any deep learning object detection model. The application of the object detection model trained using this dataset is vast, including usage in healthcare institutions and high-volume premises such as malls to ensure PPE compliance. 

## About this dataset
This dataset contains 900 images belonging to 7 different classes, including face mask (with mask, without mask, and mask weared incorrectly), face shield, coverall, gloves and goggles. The images are mainly collected from Google Image Search and some images are extracted from Youtube videos (donning/doffing PPE). The images are labelled manually using LabelImg tool and saved in PASCAL VOC format.

## Inspirations
I hope that this dataset can contribute to more applications of object detection model in the relevant field. I would love to see how the community can utilize this dataset for any future invention.
