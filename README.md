# COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detection Dataset for Object Detection Model
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the lives of all individuals on this planet Earth. Thus, I have established a labelled PPE dataset which can be used to train an object detection model to detect objects. The application of the object detection model trained using this dataset is vast, including usage in healthcare institutions and high-volume premises such as malls to ensure PPE compliance. 

## About this dataset
This dataset contains 900 images of 7 different object classes, including face mask (with mask, without mask, and mask weared incorrectly), face shield, coverall, gloves and goggles. The images are collected from Google Image Search and also images extracted from Youtube videos (donning/doffing PPE). The images are then labelled manually using LabelImg tool and saved in Pascal VOC format.

## Inspirations
I hope that this dataset can contribute to more applications of object detection model in the relevant field. I would love to continue expanding this dataset and see how the community can utilize this dataset.
